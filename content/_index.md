Hi, ZwillGen hiring committee! Welcome to my website. The Fellowship application suggested that applicants include something different to make their applications stand out. I decided to create a website so you can learn a little bit more about me. Click on the [About]({{< ref "about.md" >}}) tab to learn more about me. Additionally, I drafted a [privacy policy]({{< ref "policy.md" >}}) for my site so you can know how I collect your data.

I created this website using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) framework and I'm hosting it on [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages). You can find my website repository and code updates [here](https://github.com/derekwebberwv/webber.legal). Although I'm not a programming extraordinaire, I quickly learned the Hugo framework and can apply that same acumen as a ZwillGen Fellow.
